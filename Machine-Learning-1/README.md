## 1. **Research and Comprehend**

### - **Introduction to AI:**

  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, perception, and decision-making.
  - AI systems work by using algorithms to process data, learn patterns, and make predictions or decisions.

###  **Role of Knowledge in AI:**
   - Knowledge is essential for AI because it enables the system to make sense of data and apply reasoning. An AI system must represent knowledge to interpret, learn, and make decisions. Without knowledge representation, AI cannot understand the context or semantics behind the data it processes.

### - **Overview of Knowledge Representation:**
  - Knowledge representation is a technique used to encode knowledge in AI systems in a way that enables machines to use that knowledge to reason and make decisions.
### - Three common forms of knowledge representation in AI:
1. **Semantic Networks**: These are graph structures where nodes represent concepts, and edges represent relationships between those concepts. They help AI visualize and navigate relationships between pieces of information.
2. **Frames**: These are data structures for dividing knowledge into substructures by representing "stereotyped situations" (e.g., frames for a "car" include properties like wheels, engine, color, etc.). Frames help systems make inferences about new data based on similar situations.
3. **Logic-Based Representations**: This form of knowledge representation uses formal logic (like first-order logic) to express facts and rules about the world. It allows AI to perform logical reasoning and deduce new facts.

## 2.  **Hands-On Exploration**
### - **Case Study Selection:**
  - Example: **Medical Diagnosis System** (AI applications in healthcare)
    - Knowledge is represented in such systems using **ontologies** (hierarchical structures defining concepts, relationships, and rules about diseases, symptoms, treatments, etc.).
    - **Effectiveness**: Ontologies help the AI system reason about patient symptoms and arrive at potential diagnoses, considering large databases of medical knowledge and patient data.
### - **Representation Creation:**
  - Problem: **Diagnosing a specific disease based on symptoms**.
  - Knowledge Representation Model: **Semantic Network** for a disease diagnosis problem.
    - Create a simple network where nodes represent diseases, symptoms, and treatments. Edges define relationships such as "causes" or "treats."
    - Example:
      - Nodes: Fever, Cough, Pneumonia, Antibiotics.
      - Relationships: Fever and Cough can be symptoms of Pneumonia, Antibiotics treat Pneumonia.
