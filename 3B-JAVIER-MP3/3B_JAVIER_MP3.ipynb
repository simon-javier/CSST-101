        "\n",
        "### Knowledge Base\n",
        "A repository of information and rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Inference Engine\n",
        "A component that employs logical reasoning to analyze the knowledge base and derive conclusions or make decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In expert systems, logic plays a crucial role in knowledge representation and reasoning. Both propositional logic and predicate logic are utilized to structure the knowledge base and formulate rules that facilitate inference.\n",
        "Propositional Logic\n",
        "Propositional logic is primarily concerned with simple statements or propositions that can either be true or false. In expert systems, it is used to represent basic facts and rules. For instance, in a medical diagnosis expert system, propositional logic might be employed to connect symptoms with diagnoses:\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If a patient has a fever (P) and a cough (Q), then they may have pneumonia (R). This can be represented as:\n",

        "This structure allows the system to infer diagnoses based on observed symptoms, effectively linking multiple propositions through logical connectives.\n",
        "Predicate Logic\n",
        "Predicate logic extends propositional logic by incorporating quantifiers and variables, enabling the representation of more complex relationships between objects and their properties. This makes it particularly useful in expert systems where nuanced relationships are common.\n",
        "Structure of Predicate Logic\n",
        "Predicates: These are functions that express properties or relationships. For example, a predicate might be defined as Loves(x, y), indicating that person\n",
        "x\n",
        "x loves person\n",
        "y\n",
        "y.\n",

        "∀\n",
        "∀) and \"there exists\" (\n",
        "∃\n",
        "∃), allowing statements about collections of objects.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Knowledge Acquisition**:\n",
        "   - Capturing expert knowledge and translating it into a formal logic-based representation can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Scalability**:\n",
        "   - As the knowledge base grows, the complexity of the logical reasoning increases, which can lead to performance issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Uncertainty Handling**:\n",
        "   - While techniques exist for handling uncertainty, dealing with noisy, ambiguous, or contradictory information remains a challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Adaptability**:\n",
        "   - Logic-based models may struggle to adapt to changing environments or new situations not covered by the existing knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these obstacles, logic-based models remain significant in the field of AI, especially in areas where clarity, interpretability, and formal reasoning are essential, including medical diagnosis, legal analysis, and systems that are critical for safety."

        "\n",
        "### Overview\n",
        "This Python script showcases the application of propositional and predicate logic, along with inference techniques utilizing Modus Ponens. The model illustrates a scenario where Socrates is identified as a human, and it is established that all humans are mortal. Additionally, the script features a restaurant recommendation system that employs propositional logic to suggest appropriate dining options based on cuisine type, price range, and dietary restrictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Logic and Reasoning Process\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Predicates\n",
        "The script introduces two primary predicates:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **is_human(person)**: Determines whether a person is human.\n",
        "- **is_mortal(person)**: Assesses if a person is mortal.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Rules and Facts\n",
        "- **Rules**: A collection of rules is defined, where each rule is represented as a tuple containing:\n",
        "  - A description of the rule.\n",
        "  - A lambda function that checks if the rule holds true for a given input.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  These rules encompass various criteria such as cuisine type, price range, and dietary restrictions for the restaurant recommendation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Facts**: Facts are organized in a dictionary where:\n",
        "  - Keys denote specific assertions (e.g., Socrates is human, preference for Italian cuisine).\n",
        "  - Values indicate the truthfulness of these assertions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Modus Ponens Function\n",
        "The `modus_ponens` function accepts both rules and facts as inputs. It iterates through the rules, verifying if the premises are true based on the provided facts. If a premise is validated, it deduces the conclusion and updates the facts dictionary with new insights. The function returns a list of conclusions derived from the rules and facts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing and Inference\n",
        "The script conducts several tests to confirm the validity of the inference system:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Initial Facts**: Displays the original set of facts prior to inference.\n",
        "- **Conclusions**: Shows the conclusions drawn after applying Modus Ponens to the established rules.\n",
        "- **Updated Facts**: Lists the revised set of facts following the inference.\n",
        "- **Socrates**: Specifically verifies whether Socrates is mortal based on predicate logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing for Accuracy\n",
        "To ensure the script's accuracy:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Execute the script in a Python environment, such as Google Colab.\n",
        "- Verify the output: Confirm that the results align with the relationships defined by the rules and facts.\n",
        "- Modify facts or rules: Experiment with different scenarios by altering facts or introducing new rules, ensuring that the inference process remains functional across various situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "This script effectively illustrates the use of propositional and predicate logic, combined with Modus Ponens inference techniques. By establishing rules and facts, the script can derive new conclusions and make informed decisions based on the provided data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This framework can be further enhanced to include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- More intricate rules.\n",
        "- Additional predicates.\n",
        "- A more extensive restaurant recommendation system.\n",
        "\n",
